# biobox_add_taxid
This tool was designed to add a 'TaxID' column in a binning file in biobox format.

The main input of this tool is a binning file which can be generated by the cami amber utility script 'convert_fasta_bins_to_biobox_format.py'.

The second input of this tool can be either a contig2taxid file which can be generated by 'kraken2' or a 
binid2taxid file which looks as followed:

```
BinID   TaxID
test1   11056
test2   444944
ABC 888
....
```

the important part of this is that the first column has to be the BinID column and the last column has to be the TaxID column. There can be more the this two column but the order has to be kept.
